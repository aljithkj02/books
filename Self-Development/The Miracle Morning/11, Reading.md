-  "Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body and prayer is to the soul. We become the books we read."

- There are no limits to the knowledge you can gain through daily reading.

- Begin with the end in mind. Before you begin reading each day, ask yourself why you are reading that book - what do you want to gain from it - and keep that outcome in mind.

- Achieving master in any area requires repetition.
