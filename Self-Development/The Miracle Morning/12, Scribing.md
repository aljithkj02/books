- There are many worthwhile benefits of keeping  a daily journal.

- **Gain clarity:** The process of writing something down forces us to think through it enough to understand it. Journaling will give you more clarity, allow you to brainstorm, and help you work through problems.

- **Capture ideas:** Journaling helps you not only expand your ideas, but also prevents you from losing the important ideas that you may want to act on in the future.

- **Review lessons:** It enables you to review all of the lessons you have learned.

- **Acknowledge your progress:** It's wonderful to go back and re-read your journal entries from a year ago and see how much progress you have made. It's one of the most empowering, confidence-inspiring and enjoyable experiences. It can't really be duplicated any other way.

- Human beings are conditioned to have what I call gap focus We tend to focus on the gaps between where we are in life and where we want to be, between what we have accomplished and what we could have or want to accomplish, and the gap between who we are and our idealistic vision of the person we believe we should be.

- The problem with this is that constant 'gap focus' can be detrimental to our confidence and self-image, causing us to feel like we don' have enough, haven't accomplished enough, and that we are simply not good enough, or at least, not as good as we should be.

- The irony is that 'gap focus' is a big part of the reason that high achievers are high achievers. Their insatiable desire to close the gap is what fuels their pursuit of excellence and constantly drives them to achieve. 

- 'Gap focus' can be healthy and productive if it comes from a positive, proactive, I am committed to and excited about fulfilling my potential perspective, without any feelings of lack. Unfortunately, it rarely does The average person, even the average high achiever, tends to focus negatively on their gaps.

- The highest achievers - those who are balanced and focused on achieving Level 10 success in nearly every area of their lives - are exceedingly grateful for what they have, regularly acknowledge themselves for what they have accomplished, and are always at peace with where they are in their lives. It is the dueling idea that I am doing the best that I can in this moment, and at the same time, I can and will do better. This balanced self assessment prevents that feeling of lack - of not being, having, doing enough - while still allowing them to constantly strive to close their potential gap in each area.

- My journaling method ranges from being a very specific, structured process - listing what I'm grateful for, acknowledging my accomplishments, clarifying what areas I want to improve on, and planning which specific actions I am committed to taking to improve - to being pretty traditional, just a dated entry with a synopsis of my day.
