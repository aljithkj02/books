### Chapter 1 - Deep work is valuable

-  Our technologies are racing ahead but many of our skills and organizations are lagging behind.
- The unprecedented growth and impact of technology are creating a massive restructuring of our economy. In this new economy, these groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital.
- If you can join any of these groups, therefore, you will do well. If you cannot, you might still do well, but your position is more precarious.

#### 2 Core abilities for thriving in the new economy
1. The ability to quickly master hard things.
2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.

- We must remember that we have been spoiled by the intuitive and drop-dead-simple user experience of many consumer-facing technologies, like Twitter and the iPhone. These examples, however, are consumer products, not serious tools: Most of the intelligent machines driving the Great Restructuring are significantly more complex to understand and master.
- Intelligent machines are complicated and hard to master.*
- To join the group of those who can work well with these machines, therefore, requires that you hone your ability to master hard things. And because these technologies change rapidly, this process of mastering hard things never ends: You must be able to do it quickly, again and again.
- This ability to learn hard things quickly, of course, is not just necessary for working well with intelligent machines: it also plays a key role in the attempt to become a superstar in just about any field.
