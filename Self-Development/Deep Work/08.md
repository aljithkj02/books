- Deep work is at a severe disadvantage in a technopoly because it builds on values like quality, craftsmanship, and mastery that are decidedly old-fashioned and nontechnical.
- Deep work is exiled in favor of more distracting high-tech behaviors, like the professional use of social media, not because the former is empirically inferior to the latter.
- Deep work is hard and shallow work is easier, that in the absence of clear goals for your job, the visible busyness that surrounds shallow work becomes self-preserving.
- All of these trends are enabled by the difficulty of directly measuring the value of depth or the cost of ignoring it.
- If you believe in the value of depth, this reality spells bad news for businesses in general, as it is leading them to miss out on potentially massive increases in their value production.
- What we choose to focus on and what we choose to ignore -- plays in defining the quality of our life.
- Our brains construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to. 
- Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love -- is the sum of  what you focus on.
- To increase the time you spend in a state of depth is to leverage the complex machinery of the human brain in a way that for several different neurological reasons maximizes the meaning and satisfaction you will associate with your working life.
