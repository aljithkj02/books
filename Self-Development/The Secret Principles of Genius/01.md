- Understand that the outcomes of genius may appear easy, but the process to get there is not.

- The essence of genius is limitless. There appear to be no bounds to what geniuses can accomplish. To define it much further, is to limit something that is supposed to be limitless.

- When defining genius, it is also important to realize this is a status that is never full reached. Instead, it is something to aspire to.

- Your status of genius or non-genius is something that can be debated after your death, if people choose to. If they debate it during your life, consider it an honor. But to join the debate or try to convince people you are a genius is a waste of time.

- Genius is not a status to reach, rather it is a journey to greatness. It is the aspiration and relentless pursuit of something greater than what you are at the present moment.

- Personal qualities are important because we take them with us everywhere we go. These qualities are a deep part of who you are.
