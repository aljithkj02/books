- We all know what curiosity is. But a deep curiosity is when you want to know more. And you find some answers, you just have more and more questions. And so there is a deep need to know rising up from inside that can never be quenched. This is the experience many geniuses have had.

- When you are curious, this drives you to continue on a difficult problem when others have given up, and to truly understand everything about it. Curiosity is driven in part by understanding that there is a lot out there in the world that is unknown, waiting to be discovered. Then when you get out there, and you start discovering new things often you realize there is even more you didn't know. So you want to keep going, learning more, and the process repeats itself.

- "Amar Bose, in his daily life, he never stopped asking questions, always wondering why things did not work better, and how he could be the one to  improve them."

- Curiosity is one of the best motivators to get things done. If you have curiosity, a deep desire to know and understand, then you will make much more progress. Many times even if they are smarter or have better preparation, the person who is more curious tends to be more driven and determined, and wins out in the end.

- The curios person won't get tired of working as easily. Working will feel like play, like a chance to discover something new.

- Another benefit of being highly curious is that you will tend to learn much more that other people. When you are deeply curious, you will be driven to learn about new things. Then, as you learn, you will come up with new questions and become curious to figure out the answers to some of these questions. There is a loop here. Curiosity leads you to learn about new things. Learning about new things makes you more curious. The opposite of this is also important to consider. IF you are not curios, you do not learn about new things. If you do not learn about new things, you are not curious. A deep curiosity is a major advantage to the brilliant mind. and a lack of curiosity is serious disadvantage.

- I think many of us are naturally curious, but sometimes we don't feed it enough. Curiosity is something that must be fed to draw it out more and more. For example, when you are curious about something, it is important to investigate this further. Ask questions. Loo up information. Explore. When you take that first step, you open a door that is likely to spark your curiosity further and further.

- Our task is not to become curious, but to reawaken the curiosity already inside of us. Don't get in the habit of being silent when you have questions. We shouldn't think that other people will laugh at our ignorance or think less of us. By being too timid, we will actually grow more and more ignorant.

- Be curious and dare to ask questions. You have probably heard the saying "There are no foolish questions, only foolish people."

- Don you know someone who is very curious and asks a lot of questions? An easy way to spark your curiosity is to spend more time with that person. Curiosity is not only a great way to promote learning, but it can also be entertaining to observe the mind of a super curious person.
