- Today, most of us are very visual, and we may have to be reminded that we have other senses we can use to experience the world. As much as we use visual information, it is limiting if that is all we use.

- Realize that when you see a bird's feathers, you experience them one way. When you touch those feathers, you understand them on a much deeper level. They have texture, shape, and rigidity, for example.

- To have a brilliant mind, one must take in information. All information is received starting with the senses, and your brain's ability to interpret them. When you are learning, the more senses you use to gain information, the more channels or avenues you will have in your brain to remember and understand.

- If you work in an office you probably touch a keyboard pretty regularly. This may be stimulating when you first learn to type, but in time you become so used to the feeling that it is not very stimulating at all. We all touch things, but do you ever touch anything new? And we all smell and taste things, but do you ever do this with new things? To keep your senses strong, they need stimulation and variety.

- Our vision goes downhill when it is not exercised properly Other senses likely do too.

- On the other hand, you can choose to purposely neglect your most dominant sense for a short while. This will help to force you to pay more attention to other senses. For most of us, our dominant sense will be vision As a way to neglect this sense, you can listen to a television show with your eyes closed as you imagine the scenarios in your mind.
