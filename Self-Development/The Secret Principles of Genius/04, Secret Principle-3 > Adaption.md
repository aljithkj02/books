- Adaptation is about being willing to change your approach to a scenario or problem, depending on what the situation calls for. The person who is willing to smoothly change approach depending on the situation is highly adaptive. The person who insists he knows the one right approach, and always takes that approach no matter the situation, is not adaptive. You can't force one solution onto every single problem you have. You have to change your approach depending on the problem.

- The more adaptive a creature is, the more intelligent it is.
